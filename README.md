# Simple GUI game with C++
This is a simple GUI game developed as a project under Programming 2 course with a high level of modularity.

gamebaord.hh and gameboard.cpp modules were provided by the course personnel (responsible teacher: Maarit Harsu), howerver, those were slightly changed by me as per the requirements. Teachers instructions were taken before sharing the files here.

mainwindow.hh, mainwindow.cpp and mainwindow.ui modules were developed by myself.

Information on how to play the game is available in the instructions.txt file.
